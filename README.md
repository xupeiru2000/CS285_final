# End-to-end Pneumatic Soft Gripper Grasping Using Imitation Learning

## Abstract:
Advances in soft gripper has achieved remarkable success in grasping tasks providing superior flexibility compared to rigid grippers. However, challenges still lie in limited loading capacity and understanding the working mechanism of the soft gripper due to its nonlinear behavior. In this study, by leveraging both soft pneumatic joint and rigid parts, a hybrid gripper is developed to provide superior dexterity compared to conventional electromechanical grippers. A grasping platform is established using a robot arm equipped with the designed hybrid gripper and a depth camera imaging system. Easy and hard grasping tasks are conducted on multiple objects indicating different difficulty levels using imitation learning method. Two model-based approaches including CNN and PointNet models are implemented and show satisfying performance on grasping prediction. An average error of 5 mm towards desired grasping location is reached for the easy grasping task. It is envisioned that such platform and reinforcement learning approaches can be elevated to more complicated grasping problems including irregular shape objects that requires dedicated gestures and grasping trajectory.
